# DIY-eCar

These calculations belong to the project decribed below. Thus, the basis of physics should be available as a Python script, the documentation for this can be sent gladly on request.

The aim of this project is to create a manual for converting an combustion vehicle into an electric vehicle. The main question of the work is what theoretical knowledge do I need to realise a conversion. The focus is on enabling sustainable mobility. The theoretical basics, as well as the framework conditions for the conversion, were summarised and correspond to the main objective of this project. With the theoretical knowledge, an overview of all components used or adapted for the conversion, as well as the legal requirements in Switzerland, a first part of the manual was created.
